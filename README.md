# Efficient horizontal visibility graphs using merge trees


Implementation of $O(n)$ online algorithms for constructing HVGs and for merging existing ones.

Includes code to run numerical benchmarks to compare the proposed method of _dual tree horizontal visibility_ with two previous approaches: the binary search tree method [1] and the divide and conquer method [2].
